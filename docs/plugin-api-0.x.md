# Plugin API 0.1

This is the minimal host requested in `project/next-task.md`, not plugin API 1.0. The complete runnable example is
`plugins/example/`. It ships settings and records in both fictional workspaces.

## Discovery and configuration

A bundled or private plugin lives in `<plugins>/<name>/` with `plugin.yaml` and a Python package. Private plugins are in
`<workspace>/plugins/`. Installed distributions declare a `pm_cockpit.plugins` entry point named for the plugin and place
`plugin.yaml` beside their top-level package's `__init__.py`. Discovery reads the manifest without loading the entry point.
Duplicate discovery names are refused. Only names in `workspace.plugins.enabled` load; dependencies must also be enabled.

`depends_on` entries have `name` and `version` (a version range). Both plugin and API versions use standard version ranges.
Unknown keys anywhere in the manifest are errors. Contributions must match `provides` exactly, including optional
`provides.op_validators` entries identifying the core or own ops being validated. `subscribes` must match registrations.
Namespaces are `<plugin>/<name>`; record id prefixes must be uppercase and unique in the workspace.

`config_schema` names a subclass of `engine.plugin_api.Settings`. It forbids unknown keys and supplies `version: 1`.
Every setting must have a default and description. The host validates `config/plugins/<name>.yaml` before calling `register`.
Registration is staged: failures leave no partially installed contributions. Each store has its own module namespace and
registries, so one workspace cannot enable an op in another.

## Registration contract

Plugins import engine types only from `engine.plugin_api`; other plugin packages and engine internals are not APIs.

- `record_type(model)`: subclass `Record`, declaring `record_kind` and `prefix` class variables.
- `op(model, tier, apply)`: subclass `OpModel`, with a single literal `op` and a `writes` class variable mapping allowed record
  kinds to field tuples. `("*",)` permits creation of that kind; a field tuple permits updates only to those fields.
  `apply(op, writer, settings)` uses `writer.create(kind, data)` or
  `writer.update(kind, id, changes, read_version=version)`. It cannot replace the write context or access SQL through the API.
  API 0.1 intentionally has no delete callback surface; created records can be undone through the ledger.
- `op_validator(op_name, fn)`: `fn(op, read_view)` returns a list of refusal messages. It must be deterministic and cannot
  modify records. Validators may target core or own ops; a failed validator fails closed for the rest of the run.
- `task_kind(name, ops=..., prompt="notes", playbook="notes")`: the dispatcher uses the registered op list for parsing,
  validation, schema and reference generation. These defaults reuse the core extraction prompt/playbook. Workspace prompt
  overrides work as before. Pack-provided prompt/playbook loading is a later extension point.
- `subscribe(event, fn)`: `fn(payload, context)` reads core or own records through `get`/`list`; it can stage
  `queue_request(task, note)` or `file_question(title, text)` for the PM. Commands commit only after a successful handler.
  Requests for other plugins require the future interface mechanism and are currently refused. Plugin requests are marked
  as scheduled work; system ops never apply automatically from them.

## Events and failure behavior

Events publish after a successful transaction, never after rollback or while importing an export. `record.changed` carries
`kind`, `id`, `fields`, `version`, and the ledger `op` (including its changeset index). The bus also publishes
`request.queued`, `question.answered`, `changeset.applied`, and `changeset.undone`. A causal event chain does not re-enter the
same plugin/event handler, preventing unbounded request or record-event loops. Separate committed transactions still emit
their own events. Event payloads are copied for each handler.

Load, validation, op or event callback exceptions disable the offending plugin for the run, log the reason, and appear in
the authenticated `/api/plugins` response. Required consumers are disabled too. Unrelated plugins and core work continue.
A failed op's savepoint is rolled back; its outcome is recorded as refused. Record schemas remain available for undo and
export after a runtime failure. Restarting with the plugin enabled attempts a fresh load.

The host is not a Python sandbox. Enabling a plugin trusts its code. The API exposes no network, process, secret or sending
capability. Manifests requesting these or later extension points are refused until implemented. Version 0.1 does not yet
implement migrations, interface contracts, plugin panels, custom prompt bundles or tool runners.

## Verification

`tests/test_plugins.py` covers both fictional workspaces, core-only and enabled operation, strict manifests, compatibility,
dependencies, discovery, configuration, atomic registration, namespace enforcement, dispatcher/schema integration, tier
holding and release, validators, ledger/undo, post-commit events, handler/op failures, write scope and data preservation.
The existing boundary test and a plugin-specific test reject imports of engine internals. The self-check compares complete
nested exports, validates all bundled registrations, and checks both core-only and enabled fixture imports.


For the same core suite on copied fixtures with no plugins, run
`COCKPIT_TEST_CORE_ONLY=1 uv run pytest --ignore=tests/test_plugins.py`. The plugin contract suite runs in the normal full
suite, including its explicit core-only and enabled pipeline cases. The committed fictional fixtures are never changed by
this test mode.

## Stages

A plugin declares `provides.stage_checks` (check ids) and `provides.stages`
(record types with defaults) in its manifest. Register a pure deterministic
check with `registrar.stage_check("<plugin>/<name>", fn)`. Its signature is
`fn(record: Stored, view: ReadView, config: Settings) -> StageCheckResult`;
return both a boolean and a plain reason. The view permits core and own
records only. Checks never call AI; exceptions disable the plugin and block
entry. Put check wording in plugin settings.

Use `registrar.stages(record_type, [{id, label, entry, starts}, ...], moves=None)`
for defaults on the plugin's own types. Workspace `config/stages.yaml` accepts
`types: {record_type: {moves: person, stages: [...]}}`, or the design's shorter
`record_type: [...]` form. `moves` defaults to `person`; a type may override it
with `rule`. Each workspace list replaces the complete pack list. An empty list
removes the stages. Stored ids and ledger history survive label changes and
removed stages; no successor is inferred for an id that is no longer configured.
When disabling a plugin, remove its stage overrides and rule bindings too;
unknown record types, tasks and checks are config errors.

Rules in `config/rules.yaml` retain the metadata in design 4.10. An optional
`check` names the deterministic code check that implements a rule. Stage entry
may name the rule id. Retired, out-of-scope, and prose-only rules do not pass.
A general executable rule language remains an open design question; AI never
interprets a rule to authorize a move.

`stage.move` takes `record: {kind, id}`, `to`, and `read_version`. Every AI
proposal waits for the person, including proposals from trusted notes. The
person may enter a configured stage after its entry checks pass; the rule
worker advances only to the next configured stage. Both paths use the applier,
record exact versions, write the ledger, and support grouped Undo.

On entry, `starts` task kinds create requests with `approval: required` and
`state: needs_you`. The explicit go endpoint grants approval. Retry and direct
dispatch cannot bypass this gate. `approve_stage_request` is the integration
point for future estimates and budget authorization; request `stage_start`
metadata identifies both the task's record and originating changeset. Undo
removes pending tasks with the move, and refuses the group once a task changed.

The `stage.moved` event contains `kind`, `id`, `version`, `from`, `to`, and `op`.
It is published after commit, including reversals from Undo; rolled-back writes
emit nothing.

All endpoints are under the configured base path plus `/api`:

- `GET /records/{id}?kind=...`: record data, stage status, next checks, and ledger history.
- `GET /records/{id}/stage-history?kind=...`: stage entries and reversals from the ledger.
- `GET /stages/ready`: records whose next stage checks pass.
- `POST /stages/move`: explicit person move with the op fields above (without `op`).
- `GET /stages/requests`: task requests originating from stage entries.
- `POST /requests/{id}/go`: `{"read_version": n}` approves a waiting stage task.

No stage UI is included in this increment.
